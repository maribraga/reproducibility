# reproducibility

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of reproducibility is to make an example repository where I
will work through examples of reproducible research. I will explore the
Species_dataset and the relatioship between species abundances and
climatic variables.

For example, in the following figure we will see the relationship
between the abundances of species 4 and annual mean temperature

![Temperature vs Abundance spp
4](README_files/figure-gfm/plotspp4temp-1.png)

Inline example: 3,500, the mean temperature in the sites is 2.7.

Try plotting a table:

    #> # A tibble: 6 Ã— 4
    #>     lon   lat  bio_1 bio_2
    #>   <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>
    #> 1  12.7  63.0 -0.779  8.57
    #> 2  12.5  60.2  3.45   9.05
    #> 3  15.8  56.6  6.56   7.85
    #> 4  27.9  67.7 -1.63   8.68
    #> 5  17.6  59.6  6.02   7.72
    #> 6  23.3  60.4  4.78   7.70
