# reproducibility

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of reproducibility is to make an example repository where I
will work through examples of reproducible research. I will explore the
Species_dataset and the relatioship between species abundances and
climatic variables.

For example, in the following figure we will see the relationship
between the abundances of species 4 and annual mean temperature

![Temperature vs Abundance spp
4](README_files/figure-gfm/plotspp4temp-1.png)

Inline 3,500, the mean temperature in the sites is 2.7.

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->
<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->
<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->
<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub. -->
