# reproducibility

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of reproducibility is to make an example repository where I will work through examples of reproducible research. I will explore the Species_dataset and the relatioship between species abundances and climatic variables.

```{r packages}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r read_data}
Species_dataset <- readr::read_csv2("Species_dataset.csv")
```

For example, in the following figure we will see the relationship between the abundances of species 4 and annual mean temperature

```{r plotspp4temp, fig.cap = "Temperature vs Abundance spp 4"}
ggplot(Species_dataset, aes(bio_1, abund_sp4)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
```

Inline `r prettyNum(nrow(Species_dataset), big.mark = ",")`, the mean temperature in the sites is `r round(mean(Species_dataset$bio_1), digits = 1)`.









<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->

<!-- summary(cars) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->

<!-- plot(pressure) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub. -->
